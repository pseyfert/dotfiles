# pseyfert's dotfile repository

**Nowhere near a complete list of complete dotfiles**

This is just a place of dotfiles I regularly need on new machines which annoy
the hell out of me if they are missing or not up to date, like the xmodmap file
for the keyboard layout.

I will probably keep adding new chunks now and then whenever I feel like house
keeping in my home directory.
